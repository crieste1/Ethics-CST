# Ethics in Data Analytics: Assignment #2

## Billy Gotsch, Caroline Riester, Jordan Schilling

---

# Mater et Magistra, Saint John XXIII, 1961

## "It pains Us, therefore, to observe the __complete indifference to the true hierarchy of values__ shown by so many people in the economically developed countries. __Spiritual values are ignored, forgotten or denied, while the progress__ of science, technology and economics is __pursued for its own sake__, as though __material well-being were the be-all and end-all of life__. This __attitude is contagious__, especially when it __infects the work that is being done for the less developed countries__, which have often preserved in their ancient traditions an acute and vital awareness of the more important human values, on which the moral order rests.”

## Material wealth > Spiritual Wealth

## Developed countries corrupt less developed countries
	    
## Our mistakes impact their progress
