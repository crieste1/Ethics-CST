# Ethics in Data Analytics: Assignment #2

## Billy Gotsch, Caroline Riester, Jordan Schilling

# Mater et Magistra, Saint John XXIII, 1961

## It pains Us, therefore, to observe the _complete indifference to the true hierarchy of values_ shown by so many people in the economically developed countries. _Spiritual values are ignored, forgotten or denied, while the progress_ of science, technology and economics is _pursued for its own sake_, as though _material well-being were the be-all and end-all of life_. This _attitude is contagious_, especially when it _infects the work that is being done for the less developed countries_, which have often preserved in their ancient traditions an acute and vital awareness of the more important human values, on which the moral order rests.”
