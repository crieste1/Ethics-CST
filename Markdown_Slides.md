# Mater er Magistra, Saint John XXIII, 1961
"It pains Us, therefor, to observe the complete indifference to the true hierarchy of values shown by so many peopple in the economically developed countries. Spiritual values are ignored, forgotten or denied, while the progress of science, technology and economics is pursued for its own sake, as though material well-being were the be-all and end-all of life. This attitude is contagious, especially when it infects the work that is being done for the less developed countries, which have often preserved in their ancient traditions an acute and vital awareness of the more important human values, on which the moral order rests."
